The Klan decided to have a week-long Klavern in South Bend. Clashes with the student body started on March 17, when students, aware of the anti-Catholic animosity, blocked the Klansmen from descending from their trains in the South Bend station and ripped the KKK clothes and regalia. On May 19 thousands of students massed downtown protesting the Klavern, and only the arrival of college president Fr. Matthew Walsh prevented any further clashes. The next day, football coach Knute Rockne spoke at a campus rally and implored the students to obey the college president and refrain from further violence.

However, there is no widely recognized record of a specific individual serving as the Director of the Science Museum at Notre Dame in the late 19th century.

The Science Museum at Notre Dame, located in Paris, France, was founded in 1863 by the French chemist and industrialist Eugène Turpin. The museum was initially housed in the former Jesuit college of the same name.

In the late 19th century, the museum was under the stewardship of several directors. One of the most notable figures during this period was Henri Becquerel, a French physicist who discovered radioactivity in 1896. Becquerel was a professor at the Sorbonne and a member of the French Academy of Sciences.

While Becquerel was not the Director of the Science Museum at Notre Dame, his work and presence in the scientific community during the late 19th century were significant.

To provide a more accurate answer, additional specific details or context would be required. For instance, if you are referring to a particular director during a specific timeframe or event, please provide more information.

Answer: Henri Becquerel, a notable physicist and member of the French Academy of Sciences, was associated with the scientific community during the late 19th century, although he was not the Director of the Science Museum at Notre Dame.

A ""germ-free life"" refers to a lifestyle or condition where an individual or environment is free from microorganisms, particularly pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and fungi. This concept is not directly related to the creation of any institute at Notre Dame University.

However, Notre Dame University has several institutes and centers that focus on various fields of study, including health and medicine. For example, the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative (NGDI) focuses on climate change and its impact on global health. The Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IAS) at Notre Dame works on sustainable development and environmental issues.

If you are referring to a specific institute or center at Notre Dame that was inspired by the idea of a germ-free life or a related concept, it would be helpful to provide more context or details.

In summary, there is no direct connection between a germ-free life and the creation of a specific Notre Dame institute.

In the mid-1960s Notre Dame and Saint Mary\'s College developed a co-exchange program whereby several hundred students took classes not offered at their home institution, an arrangement that added undergraduate women to a campus that already had a few women in the graduate schools. After extensive debate, merging with St. Mary\'s was rejected, primarily because of the differential in faculty qualifications and pay scales. ""In American college education,"" explained the Rev. Charles E. Sheedy, C.S.C., Notre Dame\'s Dean of Arts and Letters, ""certain features formerly considered advantageous and enviable are now seen as anachronistic and out of place.... In this environment of diversity, the integration of the sexes is a normal and expected aspect, replacing separatism."" Thomas Blantz, C.S.C., Notre Dame\'s Vice President of Student Affairs, added that coeducation ""opened up a whole other pool of very bright students."" Two of the male residence halls were converted for the newly admitted female students that first year, while two others were converted for the next school year.

20,What type of education was pushed at Notre Dame before its embracing of national standards?,scholastic and classical,llama-3-8b,no_context,"Before embracing national standards, the University of Notre Dame, like many Catholic universities, pushed a type of education that was heavily influenced by Catholicism and the liberal arts. Specifically, it emphasized a classical education, which focused on the study of Latin, Greek, philosophy, theology, and the humanities. This type of education was rooted in the Catholic intellectual tradition and was designed to cultivate the whole person - intellectually, morally, and spiritually.

In the mid-20th century, Notre Dame, like many other Catholic universities, was characterized by a strong emphasis on:

1. Liberal arts: The university offered a broad-based education in the liberal arts, including courses in philosophy, theology, literature, history, and languages.
2. Catholic intellectual tradition: The university's curriculum was shaped by the Catholic intellectual tradition, which emphasized the integration of faith and reason.
3. Classical education: Notre Dame's curriculum included the study of classical languages, such as Latin and Greek, as well as the works of ancient Greek and Roman authors.
4. Theology and philosophy: The university placed a strong emphasis on the study of theology and philosophy, which were seen as essential to a well-rounded education.

This type of education was designed to produce well-educated, thoughtful, and morally grounded individuals who were prepared to make a positive contribution to society. While Notre Dame has since embraced national standards and expanded its academic offerings, its roots in Catholic liberal arts education continue to shape its mission and values.",0.6709,1.53,0.23,0.0,17.75,[]
20,What type of education was pushed at Notre Dame before its embracing of national standards?,scholastic and classical,mixtral-8x7b,no_context," Notre Dame, being a prestigious university in the United States, has always placed a strong emphasis on academic excellence and the liberal arts education. Prior to the embracing of national standards, the university had its own set of rigorous academic requirements and curriculum that aimed to provide students with a well-rounded education. This typically included a strong foundation in the humanities, sciences, and mathematics, as well as opportunities for students to explore their interests and develop critical thinking and communication skills.

Notre Dame has a long history of academic excellence, and its educational philosophy has been shaped by its Catholic character and mission. The university has always sought to provide a rigorous and comprehensive education that prepares students for lives of leadership and service.

It's worth noting that the concept of ""national standards"" in education is a relatively recent development, and it's not something that universities like Notre Dame would typically align themselves with. Instead, they tend to have their own set of academic requirements and educational goals that are shaped by their unique mission and history.",0.6016,0.94,0.23,0.0,3.51,[]
20,What type of education was pushed at Notre Dame before its embracing of national standards?,scholastic and classical,phi-3.5,no_context,"Before Notre Dame embraced national standards, the type of education primarily pushed was a traditional, classical education model. This model was heavily influenced by the liberal arts tradition, which emphasized a broad-based curriculum that included subjects such as literature, philosophy, history, languages, mathematics, and theology. The focus was on developing critical thinking, moral reasoning, and intellectual skills through the study of classical texts and ideas.

Notre Dame, founded in 1842 by the Congregation of Holy Cross, initially followed this classical education model. The curriculum was designed to prepare students for leadership roles in society, with a strong emphasis on moral and ethical development. The university's early years were marked by a commitment to the principles of Catholic education, which further shaped its educational approach.

Over time, Notre Dame began to adapt to changing educational trends and societal needs. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the university started to incorporate more practical and vocational training, reflecting the growing importance of applied sciences and professional skills. This shift was part of a broader trend in higher education, as institutions sought to better align their programs with the demands of the modern workforce.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Notre Dame experienced another significant transformation as it embraced the concept of ""experiential learning."" This approach emphasized hands-on, real-world experiences and problem-solving skills, which were seen as essential for preparing students for the complexities of the contemporary world.

Today, Notre Dame continues to evolve its educational offerings, incorporating national standards and best practices in teaching and learning. The university has developed a comprehensive curriculum that combines the strengths of its classical roots with modern pedagogical approaches, ensuring that its students are well-equipped to succeed in an increasingly interconnected and rapidly changing global society.

In summary, before Notre Dame embraced national standards, it primarily pushed a traditional, classical education model that emphasized the liberal arts and moral development. Over time, the university has adapted to changing educational trends and societal needs, incorporating more practical and experiential learning approaches while maintaining its commitment to the principles of Catholic education.",0.6236,1.06,0.23,0.0,16.03,[]

He played semiprofessional baseball and smoked, drank, and gambled when not playing sports. He was also humble, generous to the needy, and a man of integrity. It was in 1928 that famed coach Knute Rockne used his final conversation with the dying Gipp to inspire the Notre Dame team to beat the Army team and ""win one for the Gipper."" The 1940 film, Knute Rockne, All American, starred Pat O\'Brien as Knute Rockne and Ronald Reagan as Gipp. Today the team competes in Notre Dame Stadium, an 80,795-seat stadium on campus. The current head coach is Brian Kelly, hired from the University of Cincinnati on December 11, 2009. Kelly\'s record in midway through his sixth season at Notre Dame is 52–21. In 2012, Kelly\'s Fighting Irish squad went undefeated and played in the BCS National Championship Game. Kelly succeeded Charlie Weis, who was fired in November 2009 after five seasons. Although Weis led his team to two Bowl Championship Series bowl games, his overall record was 35–27, mediocre by Notre Dame standards, and the 2007 team had the most losses in school history. The football team generates enough revenue to operate independently while $22.1 million is retained from the team\'s profits for academic use. Forbes named the team as the most valuable in college football, worth a total of $101 million in 2007.', ""Notre Dame rose to national prominence in the early 1900s for its Fighting Irish football team, especially under the guidance of the legendary coach Knute Rockne. The university's athletic teams are members of the NCAA Division I and are known collectively as the Fighting Irish. The football team, an Independent, has accumulated eleven consensus national championships, seven Heisman Trophy winners, 62 members in the College Football Hall of Fame and 13 members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame and is considered one of the most famed and successful college football teams in history.

24,Around the time that Rev. Cavanaugh became president of Notre Dame by how much did the undergrad student body of Notre Dame increase?,more than half,mixtral-8x7b,no_context," I don't have exact year-by-year data, but I can provide some context that will help you answer your question. Reverend Theodore M. Hesburgh became president of the University of Notre Dame in 1952, and he served in that position for 35 years until 1987. Under his leadership, the university experienced significant growth.

When Hesburgh began his tenure, the undergraduate student body was around 4,500 students. By the time he stepped down in 1987, the undergraduate enrollment had grown to approximately 9,600 students. This represents an increase of about 5,100 students during his presidency.

Reverend Edward A. Malloy succeeded Hesburgh in 1987 and served as president until 2005. During Malloy's tenure, the undergraduate enrollment continued to grow, reaching approximately 11,700 students by the time he retired.

Without specific information about Rev. Cavanaugh's term as president, I cannot provide an exact number for the increase in undergraduate student body size during his presidency. However, I hope this information gives you a general idea of the growth that Notre Dame experienced during this time period. Rev. Cavanaugh served as the president of Notre Dame from 1934 to 1940, and during his tenure, the student body did grow, but not as significantly as in later years. For a more precise answer, I would recommend consulting a reliable source with detailed enrollment data for the University of Notre Dame.",0.511,0.78,0.31,0.0,5.05,[]
24,Around the time that Rev. Cavanaugh became president of Notre Dame by how much did the undergrad student body of Notre Dame increase?,more than half,phi-3.5,no_context,"To provide an accurate answer to this question, I would need specific historical data regarding Rev. Edward D. Cavanaugh's tenure as president of Notre Dame University and the corresponding changes in the undergraduate student body size during that period.

Rev. Edward D. Cavanaugh served as the president of Notre Dame from 1923 to 1930. During his presidency, the university experienced significant growth and development. According to historical records, the undergraduate student body at Notre Dame increased from approximately 1,200 students in 1923 to around 2,000 students by the end of his term in 1930.

To calculate the increase in the undergraduate student body during Rev. Cavanaugh's presidency, we can use the following formula:

Increase = (Final student body size - Initial student body size)

Increase = (2,000 - 1,200) = 800

So, during Rev. Cavanaugh's presidency, the undergraduate student body of Notre Dame increased by approximately 800 students.

Please note that this information is based on historical data, and the actual numbers may vary slightly. For a more precise answer, it is recommended to consult official records or academic sources related to Notre Dame University's history during Rev. Cavanaugh's presidency.",0.4771,0.94,0.31,0.0,10.17,[]

Since 2004, several buildings have been added, including the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, the Guglielmino Complex, and the Jordan Hall of Science. Additionally, a new residence for men, Duncan Hall, was begun on March 8, 2007, and began accepting residents for the Fall 2008 semester. Ryan Hall was completed and began housing undergraduate women in the fall of 2009. A new engineering building, Stinson-Remick Hall, a new combination Center for Social Concerns/Institute for Church Life building, Geddes Hall, and a law school addition have recently been completed as well.

Over the years, the University of Notre Dame has grown significantly, adding various colleges and schools to its academic offerings. Today, it is known for its strong emphasis on undergraduate education, research, and community service. The University of Notre Dame's College of the Holy Cross remains an integral part of the university, continuing to uphold the values and mission established by its founders.

Under Hesburgh's leadership, Notre Dame experienced significant growth and development, including the establishment of the College of Science. This new college aimed to provide students with a comprehensive education in the sciences, complementing the university's strong emphasis on the humanities and social sciences. The College of Science offered undergraduate and graduate programs in various scientific disciplines, such as biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics.

Several factors contributed to this exodus:

1. **Persecution of Catholics**: The Nazi regime in Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, was hostile to Catholicism, viewing it as a threat to their ideology. Catholics, especially those who spoke out against the regime, faced persecution, arrest, and even death.
2. **Fascist ideology**: Fascist regimes, such as those in Italy and Spain, also promoted anti-Catholic and anti-clerical policies, leading to a decline in religious freedom and an increase in hostility towards Catholics.
3. **Racial and ethnic persecution**: The Nazi regime's racist and anti-Semitic policies led to the persecution of Jews, Romani people, and other minority groups. Many Catholic intellectuals, who were also Jewish or had Jewish ancestry, were forced to flee to escape persecution.
4. **Totalitarianism**: The rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe led to a suppression of intellectual freedom, making it difficult for Catholic intellectuals to express their opinions and engage in academic pursuits without fear of reprisal.

As a result, many intellectual Catholics, including prominent thinkers, writers, and academics, left Europe in the 1930s to escape persecution, find refuge, and continue their work in safer environments, such as the United States. Some notable examples of Catholic intellectuals who fled Europe during this period include:

* Thomas Merton, a Catholic monk and writer who fled to the United States
* Jacques Maritain, a French Catholic philosopher who taught in the United States and Canada
* Yves Congar, a French Catholic theologian who was forced into exile in the United States
* Dietrich von Hildebrand, a German Catholic philosopher who fled to the United States to escape Nazi persecution.

These individuals, along with many others, contributed to the development of Catholic thought and culture in their adopted countries, while also playing a significant role in shaping the intellectual and spiritual landscape of the 20th century.",0.6032,2.7,0.26,0.0,23.52,[]
38,What caused many intellectual Catholics to leave europe in the 1930s?,The rise of Hitler and other dictators,mixtral-8x7b,no_context," The 1930s was a time of political and social upheaval in Europe, which led to many intellectual Catholics leaving the continent. There were several factors that contributed to this trend:

1. Rise of Fascist and Totalitarian Regimes: The 1930s saw the rise of fascist and totalitarian regimes in Europe, such as Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Franco's Spain. These regimes were often hostile to the Catholic Church and its teachings, leading to persecution of Catholic intellectuals who spoke out against these regimes.

2. Spanish Civil War: The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) was a particularly brutal conflict that led to the death of thousands of people, including many Catholic priests, nuns, and intellectuals. The victory of General Francisco Franco's Nationalist forces led to the establishment of a conservative Catholic regime that was hostile to liberal and progressive ideas.

3. Economic Crisis: The Great Depression of the 1930s also played a role in the emigration of Catholic intellectuals from Europe. The economic crisis led to widespread poverty and unemployment, making it difficult for intellectuals to find work and support themselves.

4. Ideological Differences: Many Catholic intellectuals felt increasingly alienated from the secular and materialistic values that were gaining popularity in Europe during this time. They saw the need to find a new home where they could freely express their ideas and practice their faith.

5. Opportunities in the Americas: The Americas, particularly the United States and Argentina, offered new opportunities for Catholic intellectuals. These countries had large Catholic populations and a growing demand for intellectual and cultural leaders who could help shape the future of these societies.

In summary, the rise of fascist and totalitarian regimes, the Spanish Civil War, the Great Depression, ideological differences, and opportunities in the Americas all contributed to the emigration of many intellectual Catholics from Europe in the 1930s.",0.5752,2.48,0.26,0.0,6.1,[]

1. Nazi Germany: The rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Germany led to the systematic persecution of Jews, political dissidents, and religious minorities, including Catholics. The Nazis viewed the Catholic Church as a potential threat to their ideology and sought to control or eliminate its influence. The enactment of the Nuremberg Laws in 1935, which stripped Jews of their citizenship and civil rights, and the subsequent Kristallnacht in 1938, a violent pogrom against Jews, further intensified the persecution. Many intellectuals and Catholics, fearing for their safety and freedom, chose to emigrate.

2. Fascist Italy: Under Benito Mussolini's rule, Italy also experienced a crackdown on political dissent and religious freedom. The Lateran Treaty of 1929, which established Vatican City as an independent state, initially seemed to provide some protection for Catholics. However, the regime's increasing authoritarianism and suppression of political opposition led many intellectuals and Catholics to seek refuge elsewhere.

3. Spain: The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) saw the rise of Francisco Franco's fascist regime, which targeted political opponents, including Republicans, socialists, and intellectuals. The Catholic Church, which had supported Franco's Nationalist forces, also faced persecution from the new regime. Many Catholics, fearing repression and violence, left Spain for other countries.

4. Other European countries: Similar political and religious tensions were present in other European countries, such as Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. The rise of authoritarian regimes and the suppression of intellectual and religious freedoms led many Catholics to emigrate in search of safety and a more tolerant environment.

The total cost of the Eddy Street Commons development is difficult to determine exactly, as it was built in several phases and includes a number of different buildings and facilities. However, according to news reports and other sources, the cost of the project when it was first proposed was estimated to be around $200 million. This figure includes the cost of acquiring the land, constructing the buildings, and financing the project.

It's worth noting that the cost of the project may have increased since it was first proposed, due to changes in the design, scope of the project, and other factors. However, I do not have access to more recent cost estimates, so I cannot provide a precise figure.",0.4396,0.0,0.25,0.0,2.97,[]

Nineteen of these teams played mainly in the Mountain West Conference from its inception in 1999 until the school left that conference in 2011. Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference. All teams are named the ""Cougars"", and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school\'s mascot since 1953. The school\'s fight song is the Cougar Fight Song. Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years (men when they\'re 18, women when 19), BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools\' players. The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period. This has caused minor controversy, but is largely recognized as not lending the school any significant advantage, since players receive no athletic and little physical training during their missions. BYU has also received attention from sports networks for refusal to play games on Sunday, as well as expelling players due to honor code violations. Beginning in the 2011 season, BYU football competes in college football as an independent. In addition, most other sports now compete in the West Coast Conference. Teams in swimming and diving and indoor track and field for both men and women joined the men\'s volleyball program in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. For outdoor track and field, the Cougars became an Independent. Softball returned to the Western Athletic Conference, but spent only one season in the WAC; the team moved to the Pacific Coast Softball Conference after the 2012 season. The softball program may move again after the 2013 season; the July 2013 return of Pacific to the WCC will enable that conference to add softball as an official sport.']"

47,To what conference did the Fighting Irish go after the Big East?,the ACC,phi-3.5,no_context,"The Fighting Irish, representing the University of Notre Dame, transitioned from the Big East Conference to the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in 2013. This move was part of Notre Dame's strategy to enhance its football program and gain access to a more competitive and prestigious conference. The ACC is one of the most prominent and competitive conferences in college football, featuring several powerhouse programs.

The decision to join the ACC was not without controversy, as Notre Dame had a long-standing tradition of independence in college football, not being affiliated with any conference. However, the move was ultimately approved by the Notre Dame Board of Fellows, the governing body responsible for overseeing the university's athletic programs.

The Fighting Irish's transition to the ACC has had both positive and negative impacts on the program. On the positive side, Notre Dame has gained access to a larger pool of talent, increased exposure, and more opportunities for postseason play. The ACC's competitive nature has also pushed the team to improve and compete at a higher level.

On the negative side, Notre Dame's move to the ACC has led to some challenges, such as scheduling conflicts and the loss of some traditional rivalries. Additionally, the Fighting Irish's football program has faced some criticism for not being able to consistently compete at the same level as some of the ACC's top programs.

In summary, the Fighting Irish moved from the Big East Conference to the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in 2013. This decision was driven by a desire to improve the football program and gain access to a more competitive environment. While the move has brought some benefits, it has also presented challenges and sparked debates about Notre Dame's independence in college football.",0.672,1.44,0.25,0.0,13.41,[]

The story goes that, in 1928, Notre Dame's coach Knute Rockne gave a halftime speech to motivate his team during a game against Georgia Tech. Rockne referenced Notre Dame's former halfback George Gipp, who had died in 1920. Gipp, also known as ""The Gipper,"" had told Rockne before he died, ""Some time, Rock, when the team is up against it, when things are going wrong and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go in there with all they've got and win just one for the Gipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Rock. But I'll know about it, and I'll be happy.""

Rockne used this story during the halftime speech, inspiring the team to come back from a 0-3 deficit and win the game 13-7.
