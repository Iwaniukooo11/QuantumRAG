    "312":"Before embracing national standards, the University of Notre Dame, like many Catholic universities, pushed a type of education that was heavily influenced by Catholicism and the liberal arts. Specifically, it emphasized a classical education, which focused on the study of Latin, Greek, philosophy, theology, and the humanities. This type of education was rooted in the Catholic intellectual tradition and was designed to cultivate the whole person - intellectually, morally, and spiritually.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, Notre Dame, like many other Catholic universities, was characterized by a strong emphasis on:\n\n1. Liberal arts: The university offered a broad-based education in the liberal arts, including courses in philosophy, theology, literature, history, and languages.\n2. Catholic intellectual tradition: The university's curriculum was shaped by the Catholic intellectual tradition, which emphasized the integration of faith and reason.\n3. Classical education: Notre Dame's curriculum included the study of classical languages, such as Latin and Greek, as well as the works of ancient Greek and Roman authors.\n4. Theology and philosophy: The university placed a strong emphasis on the study of theology and philosophy, which were seen as essential to a well-rounded education.\n\nThis type of education was designed to produce well-educated, thoughtful, and morally grounded individuals who were prepared to make a positive contribution to society. While Notre Dame has since embraced national standards and expanded its academic offerings, its roots in Catholic liberal arts education continue to shape its mission and values.",
    "313":" Notre Dame, being a prestigious university in the United States, has always placed a strong emphasis on academic excellence and the liberal arts education. Prior to the embracing of national standards, the university had its own set of rigorous academic requirements and curriculum that aimed to provide students with a well-rounded education. This typically included a strong foundation in the humanities, sciences, and mathematics, as well as opportunities for students to explore their interests and develop critical thinking and communication skills.\n\nNotre Dame has a long history of academic excellence, and its educational philosophy has been shaped by its Catholic character and mission. The university has always sought to provide a rigorous and comprehensive education that prepares students for lives of leadership and service.\n\nIt's worth noting that the concept of \"national standards\" in education is a relatively recent development, and it's not something that universities like Notre Dame would typically align themselves with. Instead, they tend to have their own set of academic requirements and educational goals that are shaped by their unique mission and history.",
    "314":"Before Notre Dame embraced national standards, the type of education primarily pushed was a traditional, classical education model. This model was heavily influenced by the liberal arts tradition, which emphasized a broad-based curriculum that included subjects such as literature, philosophy, history, languages, mathematics, and theology. The focus was on developing critical thinking, moral reasoning, and intellectual skills through the study of classical texts and ideas.\n\nNotre Dame, founded in 1842 by the Congregation of Holy Cross, initially followed this classical education model. The curriculum was designed to prepare students for leadership roles in society, with a strong emphasis on moral and ethical development. The university's early years were marked by a commitment to the principles of Catholic education, which further shaped its educational approach.\n\nOver time, Notre Dame began to adapt to changing educational trends and societal needs. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the university started to incorporate more practical and vocational training, reflecting the growing importance of applied sciences and professional skills. This shift was part of a broader trend in higher education, as institutions sought to better align their programs with the demands of the modern workforce.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Notre Dame experienced another significant transformation as it embraced the concept of \"experiential learning.\" This approach emphasized hands-on, real-world experiences and problem-solving skills, which were seen as essential for preparing students for the complexities of the contemporary world.\n\nToday, Notre Dame continues to evolve its educational offerings, incorporating national standards and best practices in teaching and learning. The university has developed a comprehensive curriculum that combines the strengths of its classical roots with modern pedagogical approaches, ensuring that its students are well-equipped to succeed in an increasingly interconnected and rapidly changing global society.\n\nIn summary, before Notre Dame embraced national standards, it primarily pushed a traditional, classical education model that emphasized the liberal arts and moral development. Over time, the university has adapted to changing educational trends and societal needs, incorporating more practical and experiential learning approaches while maintaining its commitment to the principles of Catholic education.",

Under his leadership, the university experienced significant growth.\n\nWhen Hesburgh began his tenure, the undergraduate student body was around 4,500 students.

According to historical records, the undergraduate student body at Notre Dame increased from approximately 1,200 students in 1923 to around 2,000 students by the end of his term in 1930.\n\nTo calculate the increase in the undergraduate student body during Rev. Cavanaugh's presidency, we can use the following formula:\n\nIncrease = (Final student body size - Initial student body size)\n\nIncrease = (2,000 - 1,200) = 800\n\nSo, during Rev. Cavanaugh's presidency, the undergraduate student body of Notre Dame increased by approximately 800 students.\n\nPlease note that this information is based on historical data, and the actual numbers may vary slightly.

    "582":"The rise of fascist and Nazi regimes in Europe, particularly in Germany and Italy, caused many intellectual Catholics to leave the continent in the 1930s. Several factors contributed to this exodus:\n\n1. **Persecution of Catholics**: The Nazi regime in Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, was hostile to Catholicism, viewing it as a threat to their ideology. Catholics, especially those who spoke out against the regime, faced persecution, arrest, and even death.\n2. **Fascist ideology**: Fascist regimes, such as those in Italy and Spain, also promoted anti-Catholic and anti-clerical policies, leading to a decline in religious freedom and an increase in hostility towards Catholics.\n3. **Racial and ethnic persecution**: The Nazi regime's racist and anti-Semitic policies led to the persecution of Jews, Romani people, and other minority groups. Many Catholic intellectuals, who were also Jewish or had Jewish ancestry, were forced to flee to escape persecution.\n4. **Totalitarianism**: The rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe led to a suppression of intellectual freedom, making it difficult for Catholic intellectuals to express their opinions and engage in academic pursuits without fear of reprisal.\n\nAs a result, many intellectual Catholics, including prominent thinkers, writers, and academics, left Europe in the 1930s to escape persecution, find refuge, and continue their work in safer environments, such as the United States. Some notable examples of Catholic intellectuals who fled Europe during this period include:\n\n* Thomas Merton, a Catholic monk and writer who fled to the United States\n* Jacques Maritain, a French Catholic philosopher who taught in the United States and Canada\n* Yves Congar, a French Catholic theologian who was forced into exile in the United States\n* Dietrich von Hildebrand, a German Catholic philosopher who fled to the United States to escape Nazi persecution.\n\nThese individuals, along with many others, contributed to the development of Catholic thought and culture in their adopted countries, while also playing a significant role in shaping the intellectual and spiritual landscape of the 20th century.",
    "583":" The 1930s was a time of political and social upheaval in Europe, which led to many intellectual Catholics leaving the continent. There were several factors that contributed to this trend:\n\n1. Rise of Fascist and Totalitarian Regimes: The 1930s saw the rise of fascist and totalitarian regimes in Europe, such as Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Franco's Spain. These regimes were often hostile to the Catholic Church and its teachings, leading to persecution of Catholic intellectuals who spoke out against these regimes.\n\n2. Spanish Civil War: The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) was a particularly brutal conflict that led to the death of thousands of people, including many Catholic priests, nuns, and intellectuals. The victory of General Francisco Franco's Nationalist forces led to the establishment of a conservative Catholic regime that was hostile to liberal and progressive ideas.\n\n3. Economic Crisis: The Great Depression of the 1930s also played a role in the emigration of Catholic intellectuals from Europe. The economic crisis led to widespread poverty and unemployment, making it difficult for intellectuals to find work and support themselves.\n\n4. Ideological Differences: Many Catholic intellectuals felt increasingly alienated from the secular and materialistic values that were gaining popularity in Europe during this time. They saw the need to find a new home where they could freely express their ideas and practice their faith.\n\n5. Opportunities in the Americas: The Americas, particularly the United States and Argentina, offered new opportunities for Catholic intellectuals. These countries had large Catholic populations and a growing demand for intellectual and cultural leaders who could help shape the future of these societies.\n\nIn summary, the rise of fascist and totalitarian regimes, the Spanish Civil War, the Great Depression, ideological differences, and opportunities in the Americas all contributed to the emigration of many intellectual Catholics from Europe in the 1930s.",
    "584":"The mass departure of many intellectual Catholics from Europe in the 1930s, often referred to as the \"Catholic exodus,\" was primarily caused by the rise of totalitarian regimes and the increasing persecution of religious and intellectual minorities in several European countries.\n\n1. Nazi Germany: The rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Germany led to the systematic persecution of Jews, political dissidents, and religious minorities, including Catholics. The Nazis viewed the Catholic Church as a potential threat to their ideology and sought to control or eliminate its influence. The enactment of the Nuremberg Laws in 1935, which stripped Jews of their citizenship and civil rights, and the subsequent Kristallnacht in 1938, a violent pogrom against Jews, further intensified the persecution. Many intellectuals and Catholics, fearing for their safety and freedom, chose to emigrate.\n\n2. Fascist Italy: Under Benito Mussolini's rule, Italy also experienced a crackdown on political dissent and religious freedom. The Lateran Treaty of 1929, which established Vatican City as an independent state, initially seemed to provide some protection for Catholics. However, the regime's increasing authoritarianism and suppression of political opposition led many intellectuals and Catholics to seek refuge elsewhere.\n\n3. Spain: The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) saw the rise of Francisco Franco's fascist regime, which targeted political opponents, including Republicans, socialists, and intellectuals. The Catholic Church, which had supported Franco's Nationalist forces, also faced persecution from the new regime. Many Catholics, fearing repression and violence, left Spain for other countries.\n\n4. Other European countries: Similar political and religious tensions were present in other European countries, such as Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. The rise of authoritarian regimes and the suppression of intellectual and religious freedoms led many Catholics to emigrate in search of safety and a more tolerant environment.\n\n5. Economic factors: The Great Depression, which began in 1929, had a significant impact on Europe's economy, leading to high un",

The ACC's competitive nature has also pushed the team to improve and compete at a higher level.\n\nOn the negative side, Notre Dame's move to the ACC has led to some challenges, such as scheduling conflicts and the loss of some traditional rivalries. Additionally, the Fighting Irish's football program has faced some criticism for not being able to consistently compete at the same level as some of the ACC's top programs.\n\nIn summary, the Fighting Irish moved from the Big East Conference to the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in 2013. This decision was driven by a desire to improve the football program and gain access to a more competitive environment. While the move has brought some benefits, it has also presented challenges and sparked debates about Notre Dame's independence in college football.",

Alexis Herman: She served as the Secretary of Labor from 1997 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton. She did attend Notre Dame, but it was the all-women's college Notre Dame of Maryland, not the University of Notre Dame.\n3. Jeannette Rankin: Although she was not a Secretary of State, she was the first woman to hold federal office in the United States, serving as a Congresswoman from Montana. She attended the University of Washington, but not Notre Dame.\n\nAs of now, there has not been a Secretary of State who has attended the University of Notre Dame.",
    "839":"There isn't a specific Secretary of State who attended Notre Dame University. The Secretary of State is a high-ranking official in the U.S. government responsible for foreign affairs and diplomacy. They typically have extensive professional careers in law, politics, or international relations, but there is no public record of a Secretary of State attending Notre Dame University.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that several Secretaries of State have attended prestigious universities, including Harvard, Yale, and Columbia. For example, John Kerry, who served as Secretary of State from 2013 to 2017, attended Yale University. Similarly, Madeleine Albright, who served from 1997 to 2001, attended Wellesley College and Columbia University.\n\nIf you are looking for information about a specific Secretary of State's educational background, I would recommend conducting a more targeted search using their name and relevant keywords."

The moon is under her feet and a halo of twelve stars surround her head, possibly a reference to \"a woman clothed with the sun\" from Revelation 12:1-2.

Around 21–24% of students are children of alumni, and although 37% of students come from the Midwestern United States, the student body represents all 50 states and 100 countries. As of March 2007[update] The Princeton Review ranked the school as the fifth highest 'dream school' for parents to send their children. As of March 2015[update] The Princeton Review ranked Notre Dame as the ninth highest. The school has been previously criticized for its lack of diversity, and The Princeton Review ranks the university highly among schools at which \"Alternative Lifestyles [are] Not an Alternative.\" It has also been commended by some diversity oriented publications; Hispanic Magazine in 2004 ranked the university ninth on its list of the top–25 colleges for Latinos, and The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education recognized the university in 2006 for raising enrollment of African-American students. With 6,000 participants, the university's intramural sports program was named in 2004 by Sports Illustrated as the best program in the country, while in 2007 The Princeton Review named it as the top school where \"Everyone Plays Intramural Sports.\" The annual Bookstore Basketball tournament is the largest outdoor five-on-five tournament in the world with over 700 teams participating each year, while the Notre Dame Men's Boxing Club hosts the annual Bengal Bouts tournament that raises money for the Holy Cross Missions in Bangladesh.",
      "In the 18 years under the presidency of Edward Malloy, C.S.C., (1987–2005), there was a rapid growth in the school's reputation, faculty, and resources. He increased the faculty by more than 500 professors; the academic quality of the student body has improved dramatically, with the average SAT score rising from 1240 to 1360; the number of minority students more than doubled; the endowment grew from $350 million to more than $3 billion; the annual operating budget rose from $177 million to more than $650 million; and annual research funding improved from $15 million to more than $70 million. Notre Dame's most recent[when?] capital campaign raised $1.1 billion, far exceeding its goal of $767 million, and is the largest in the history of Catholic higher education."

      "As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut."

The undergraduate component of the university is organized into four colleges (Arts and Letters, Science, Engineering, Business) and the Architecture School. The latter is known for teaching New Classical Architecture and for awarding the globally renowned annual Driehaus Architecture Prize. Notre Dame's graduate program has more than 50 master's, doctoral and professional degree programs offered by the five schools, with the addition of the Notre Dame Law School and a MD-PhD program offered in combination with IU medical School. It maintains a system of libraries, cultural venues, artistic and scientific museums, including Hesburgh Library and the Snite Museum of Art. Over 80% of the university's 8,000 undergraduates live on campus in one of 29 single-sex residence halls, each with its own traditions, legacies, events and intramural sports teams. The university counts approximately 120,000 alumni, considered among the strongest alumni networks among U.S. colleges.",

The academic profile of the enrolled class continues to rate among the top 10 to 15 in the nation for national research universities. The university practices a non-restrictive early action policy that allows admitted students to consider admission to Notre Dame as well as any other colleges to which they were accepted. 1,400 of the 3,577 (39.1%) were admitted under the early action plan. Admitted students came from 1,311 high schools and the average student traveled more than 750 miles to Notre Dame, making it arguably the most representative university in the United States. While all entering students begin in the College of the First Year of Studies, 25% have indicated they plan to study in the liberal arts or social sciences, 24% in engineering, 24% in business, 24% in science, and 3% in architecture.",
      "The College of Engineering was established in 1920, however, early courses in civil and mechanical engineering were a part of the College of Science since the 1870s. Today the college, housed in the Fitzpatrick, Cushing, and Stinson-Remick Halls of Engineering, includes five departments of study – aerospace and mechanical engineering, chemical and biomolecular engineering, civil engineering and geological sciences, computer science and engineering, and electrical engineering – with eight B.S. degrees offered. Additionally, the college offers five-year dual degree programs with the Colleges of Arts and Letters and of Business awarding additional B.A. and Master of Business Administration (MBA) degrees, respectively."

Collectively, Catholic Mass is celebrated over 100 times per week on campus, and a large campus ministry program provides for the faith needs of the community. There are multitudes of religious statues and artwork around campus, most prominent of which are the statue of Mary on the Main Building, the Notre Dame Grotto, and the Word of Life mural on Hesburgh Library depicting Christ as a teacher.

      "The university first offered graduate degrees, in the form of a Master of Arts (MA), in the 1854–1855 academic year. The program expanded to include Master of Laws (LL.M.) and Master of Civil Engineering in its early stages of growth, before a formal graduate school education was developed with a thesis not required to receive the degrees. This changed in 1924 with formal requirements developed for graduate degrees, including offering Doctorate (PhD) degrees. Today each of the five colleges offer graduate education.

      "The success of its football team made Notre Dame a household name. The success of Note Dame reflected rising status of Irish Americans and Catholics in the 1920s. Catholics rallied up around the team and listen to the games on the radio, especially when it knocked off the schools that symbolized the Protestant establishment in America — Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Army. Yet this role as high-profile flagship institution of Catholicism made it an easy target of anti-Catholicism. The most remarkable episode of violence was the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan in 1924. Nativism and anti-Catholicism, especially when directed towards immigrants, were cornerstones of the KKK's rhetoric, and Notre Dame was seen as a symbol of the threat posed by the Catholic Church. The Klan decided to have a week-long Klavern in South Bend. Clashes with the student body started on March 17, when students, aware of the anti-Catholic animosity, blocked the Klansmen from descending from their trains in the South Bend station and ripped the KKK clothes and regalia. On May 19 thousands of students massed downtown protesting the Klavern, and only the arrival of college president Fr. Matthew Walsh prevented any further clashes. The next day, football coach Knute Rockne spoke at a campus rally and implored the students to obey the college president and refrain from further violence. A few days later the Klavern broke up, but the hostility shown by the students was an omen and a contribution to the downfall of the KKK in Indiana.",

Collectively, Catholic Mass is celebrated over 100 times per week on campus, and a large campus ministry program provides for the faith needs of the community. There are multitudes of religious statues and artwork around campus, most prominent of which are the statue of Mary on the Main Building, the Notre Dame Grotto, and the Word of Life mural on Hesburgh Library depicting Christ as a teacher. Additionally, every classroom displays a crucifix. There are many religious clubs (catholic and non-Catholic) at the school, including Council #1477 of the Knights of Columbus (KOC), Baptist Collegiate Ministry (BCM), Jewish Club, Muslim Student Association, Orthodox Christian Fellowship, The Mormon Club, and many more. The Notre Dame KofC are known for being the first collegiate council of KofC, operating a charitable concession stand during every home football game and owning their own building on campus which can be used as a cigar lounge. Fifty-seven chapels are located throughout the campus."

Many academic building were added together with a system of libraries, the most prominent of which is the Theodore Hesburgh Library, built in 1963 and today containing almost 4 million books. Since 2004, several buildings have been added, including the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, the Guglielmino Complex, and the Jordan Hall of Science. Additionally, a new residence for men, Duncan Hall, was begun on March 8, 2007, and began accepting residents for the Fall 2008 semester. Ryan Hall was completed and began housing undergraduate women in the fall of 2009. A new engineering building, Stinson-Remick Hall, a new combination Center for Social Concerns\/Institute for Church Life building, Geddes Hall, and a law school addition have recently been completed as well. Additionally the new hockey arena opened in the fall of 2011. The Stayer Center for Executive Education, which houses the Mendoza College of Business Executive Education Department opened in March 2013 just South of the Mendoza College of Business building. Because of its long athletic tradition, the university features also many building dedicated to sport. The most famous is Notre Dame Stadium, home of the Fighting Irish football team; it has been renovated several times and today it can hold more than 80 thousand people. Prominent venues include also the Edmund P. Joyce Center, with indoor basketball and volleyball courts, and the Compton Family Ice Arena, a two-rink facility dedicated to hockey.

The undergraduate component of the university is organized into four colleges (Arts and Letters, Science, Engineering, Business) and the Architecture School. The latter is known for teaching New Classical Architecture and for awarding the globally renowned annual Driehaus Architecture Prize. Notre Dame's graduate program has more than 50 master's, doctoral and professional degree programs offered by the five schools, with the addition of the Notre Dame Law School and a MD-PhD program offered in combination with IU medical School. It maintains a system of libraries, cultural venues, artistic and scientific museums, including Hesburgh Library and the Snite Museum of Art. Over 80% of the university's 8,000 undergraduates live on campus in one of 29 single-sex residence halls, each with its own traditions, legacies, events and intramural sports teams.

The most remarkable episode of violence was the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan in 1924.

Clashes with the student body started on March 17, when students, aware of the anti-Catholic animosity, blocked the Klansmen from descending from their trains in the South Bend station and ripped the KKK clothes and regalia. On May 19 thousands of students massed downtown protesting the Klavern, and only the arrival of college president Fr. Matthew Walsh prevented any further clashes. The next day, football coach Knute Rockne spoke at a campus rally and implored the students to obey the college president and refrain from further violence. A few days later the Klavern broke up, but the hostility shown by the students was an omen and a contribution to the downfall of the KKK in Indiana."

Clashes with the student body started on March 17, when students, aware of the anti-Catholic animosity, blocked the Klansmen from descending from their trains in the South Bend station and ripped the KKK clothes and regalia. On May 19 thousands of students massed downtown protesting the Klavern, and only the arrival of college president Fr. Matthew Walsh prevented any further clashes. The next day, football coach Knute Rockne spoke at a campus rally and implored the students to obey the college president and refrain from further violence. A few days later the Klavern broke up, but the hostility shown by the students was an omen and a contribution to the downfall of the KKK in Indiana.",
      "In 1919 Father James Burns became president of Notre Dame, and in three years he produced an academic revolution that brought the school up to national standards by adopting the elective system and moving away from the university's traditional scholastic and classical emphasis. By contrast, the Jesuit colleges, bastions of academic conservatism, were reluctant to move to a system of electives. Their graduates were shut out of Harvard Law School for that reason. Notre Dame continued to grow over the years, adding more colleges, programs, and sports teams. By 1921, with the addition of the College of Commerce, Notre Dame had grown from a small college to a university with five colleges and a professional law school. The university continued to expand and add new residence halls and buildings with each subsequent president.",
      "Notre Dame rose to national prominence in the early 1900s for its Fighting Irish football team, especially under the guidance of the legendary coach Knute Rockne. The university's athletic teams are members of the NCAA Division I and are known collectively as the Fighting Irish. The football team, an Independent, has accumulated eleven consensus national championships, seven Heisman Trophy winners, 62 members in the College Football Hall of Fame and 13 members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame and is considered one of the most famed and successful college football teams in history. Other ND teams, chiefly in the Atlantic Coast Conference, have accumulated 16 national championships. The Notre Dame Victory March is often regarded as the most famous and recognizable collegiate fight song."

      "The success of its football team made Notre Dame a household name. The success of Note Dame reflected rising status of Irish Americans and Catholics in the 1920s. Catholics rallied up around the team and listen to the games on the radio, especially when it knocked off the schools that symbolized the Protestant establishment in America — Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Army. Yet this role as high-profile flagship institution of Catholicism made it an easy target of anti-Catholicism. The most remarkable episode of violence was the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan in 1924.

Notre Dame continued to grow over the years, adding more colleges, programs, and sports teams. By 1921, with the addition of the College of Commerce, Notre Dame had grown from a small college to a university with five colleges and a professional law school.

They compete as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I, primarily competing in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) for all sports since the 2013–14 school year. The Fighting Irish previously competed in the Horizon League from 1982-83 to 1985-86, and again from 1987-88 to 1994-95, and then in the Big East Conference through 2012–13. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, crew, cross country, fencing, football, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, fencing, golf, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field and volleyball. The football team competes as an Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) Independent since its inception in 1887. Both fencing teams compete in the Midwest Fencing Conference, and the men's ice hockey team competes in Hockey East.",
      "BYU has 21 NCAA varsity teams. Nineteen of these teams played mainly in the Mountain West Conference from its inception in 1999 until the school left that conference in 2011. Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference. All teams are named the \"Cougars\", and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school's mascot since 1953. The school's fight song is the Cougar Fight Song. Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years (men when they're 18, women when 19), BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools' players. The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period. This has caused minor controversy, but is largely recognized as not lending the school any significant advantage, since players receive no athletic and little physical training during their missions. BYU has also received attention from sports networks for refusal to play games on Sunday, as well as expelling players due to honor code violations. Beginning in the 2011 season, BYU football competes in college football as an independent. In addition, most other sports now compete in the West Coast Conference. Teams in swimming and diving and indoor track and field for both men and women joined the men's volleyball program in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. For outdoor track and field, the Cougars became an Independent. Softball returned to the Western Athletic Conference, but spent only one season in the WAC; the team moved to the Pacific Coast Softball Conference after the 2012 season. The softball program may move again after the 2013 season; the July 2013 return of Pacific to the WCC will enable that conference to add softball as an official sport.",
      "Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers. The leprechaun was featured on the cover of Time in November 1964 and gained national exposure."

Men's sports include baseball, basketball, crew, cross country, fencing, football, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, fencing, golf, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field and volleyball.

      "BYU has 21 NCAA varsity teams. Nineteen of these teams played mainly in the Mountain West Conference from its inception in 1999 until the school left that conference in 2011. Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference. All teams are named the \"Cougars\", and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school's mascot since 1953. The school's fight song is the Cougar Fight Song. Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years (men when they're 18, women when 19), BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools' players. The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period. This has caused minor controversy, but is largely recognized as not lending the school any significant advantage, since players receive no athletic and little physical training during their missions. BYU has also received attention from sports networks for refusal to play games on Sunday, as well as expelling players due to honor code violations. Beginning in the 2011 season, BYU football competes in college football as an independent. In addition, most other sports now compete in the West Coast Conference. Teams in swimming and diving and indoor track and field for both men and women joined the men's volleyball program in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.

The current head coach is Brian Kelly, hired from the University of Cincinnati on December 11, 2009. Kelly's record in midway through his sixth season at Notre Dame is 52–21. In 2012, Kelly's Fighting Irish squad went undefeated and played in the BCS National Championship Game. Kelly succeeded Charlie Weis, who was fired in November 2009 after five seasons. Although Weis led his team to two Bowl Championship Series bowl games, his overall record was 35–27, mediocre by Notre Dame standards, and the 2007 team had the most losses in school history. The football team generates enough revenue to operate independently while $22.1 million is retained from the team's profits for academic use. Forbes named the team as the most valuable in college football, worth a total of $101 million in 2007."

      "The Notre Dame football team has a long history, first beginning when the Michigan Wolverines football team brought football to Notre Dame in 1887 and played against a group of students. In the long history since then, 13 Fighting Irish teams have won consensus national championships (although the university only claims 11), along with another nine teams being named national champion by at least one source. Additionally, the program has the most members in the College Football Hall of Fame, is tied with Ohio State University with the most Heisman Trophies won, and have the highest winning percentage in NCAA history.
